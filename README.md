Zeigometer
==========

![zeigometer](doc/zeigometer.jpg)

The zeigometer is an autonmous device that can show a value on a
scale. It can be made of a an ESP8266, a servo motor, a powerbank and
some housing - I used an ice-cream package for this.

The servo motor is connected to an ESP8266, reads analog values from a
web ressource and  sends the value to a servo that visualizes the value
on a scale. The project is mainly inspired by the
[pingo meter project](https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/pingometer/)
from the Raspberry Pi Magazine.

Process Sequence
----------------

Here is what the device actually does.

1. Power on
2. Connect to a pre-configured Wifi-AP
3. Fetch a value from a pre-configured web ressource. The ressource
   can be a file on a webserver. I should only contain an integer
   value between 0 and 100.
4. Adjust the needle connected to a servo motor to reflect the value -
   0=left, 100=right.
5. Go into deep sleep for some pre-configured period of time.
6. Awake and start from the beginning.

- The servo is connected to the VCC and Ground for power supply.
- GPIO12 (or what ever is configured) is used as PWM pin for
  controlling the servo.
- GPIO16 and REST are connected to awake the ESP8266 from deep sleep
  mode. GPIO16 is the only pin that can be used for this purpose.

Configuration
-------------

Move [config_sample.py](config_sample.py) to `config.py` and adjust
the values. The file contains comment that explain what the values actually mean.

Installation
------------

The ESP8266 needs to be
[flashed with a Micropython firmware](http://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/esp8266/tutorial/intro.html#deploying-the-firmware).

Transfer all python files onto the ESP8266. A tool
like [ampy](https://github.com/adafruit/ampy) helps a lot during this
process.


Making
------

The servo is hosted in a plastic ice-cream package. A hole was
drilled to stuff the motor through. The servo itself is glued to the
cover with hot glue.

Finally a scale is made that hides the shitty cover. Here is
the [template file](doc/scale_template.svg) for this.

Powering
--------

As the the device should work autonomously it still needs some
power. The easiest way to do this would be to use a small
powerbank. However, since the ESP8266 has very low power consumption
of about 20 ÂµA in deep sleep mode, the powerbank may turn itself off
automatically.
