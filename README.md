Zeigometer
==========

A servo is connected to an ESP8266, reads analog values from an MQTT
Broker and sends them to a servo that visualizes these values on a
scale. The project is mainly inspired by the
[pingo meter project](https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/pingometer/)
from the Raspberry Pi Magazine.
